# React Shopping List
## Description

This project involved developing a fully-functioning Shopping List CRUD in order to keep track of purchases and provide a reusable list for multiple trips to the grocery store. Each item can be purchased and sent to the bottom of the list, or removed entirely. 

The list can also be cleared of all purchases or deleted, however those functions warn the user before executing to prevent accidental deletion of important information.

The list is presented in large, conveniently-spaced boxes so each item and its quantity are easy to read and distinguish from other items.
